An Active Admin plugin to use [medium-editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor), a compact and clean WYSIWYG editor.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: while I like the Medium Editor idea of having floating buttons, it looks like that they are slow to release new stable versions. Some editor bugs are related to this problem unfortunately.

## Usage

- After the installation, select some text in the editor
- A pop-up menu is shown with the available buttons
- Click on a button and the effect will be applied to the selected text

## Install

- After installing Active Admin, add to your Gemfile: `gem 'activeadmin_medium_editor'`
- Add also a SASS/SCSS gem to your Gemfile (ex. `gem 'sassc'`)
- Add at the end of your Active Admin styles (_app/assets/stylesheets/active_admin.scss_):
```scss
@import 'activeadmin/medium_editor/medium_editor';
@import 'activeadmin/medium_editor_input';
@import 'activeadmin/medium_editor/themes/default'; // or another theme
```
- Add at the end of your Active Admin javascripts (_app/assets/javascripts/active_admin.js_):
```js
//= require activeadmin/medium_editor/medium_editor
//= require activeadmin/medium_editor_input
```
- Use the input with `as: :medium_editor` in Active Admin model conf
- **data-options**: permits to set *medium-editor* options directly - see [options list](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor#mediumeditor-options) (examples below)

> Why 2 separated scripts/styles? In this way you can include a different version of *medium-editor* if you like

> **UPDATE FROM VERSION < 0.2.8**: please change your _app/assets/stylesheets/active_admin.scss_ using the new import lines above

## Examples

### Basic usage

```ruby
# Active Admin post form conf:
  form do |f|
    f.inputs 'Post' do
      f.input :title
      f.input :description, as: :medium_editor, input_html: { data: { options: '{"spellcheck":false,"toolbar":{"buttons":["bold","italic","underline","anchor"]}}' } }
      f.input :published
    end
    f.actions
  end
```

### Buttons configuration

```ruby
toolbar = { buttons: %w[bold italic underline strikethrough subscript superscript anchor image quote pre orderedlist unorderedlist indent outdent justifyLeft justifyCenter justifyRight justifyFull h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 removeFormat html] }
f.input :description, as: :medium_editor, input_html: { data: { options: { toolbar: toolbar } } }
```

For details about the buttons' effect please refer to medium-editor documentation.
